# tmxparser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmxparser/tmxparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m-waka/tmxparser)

This is a C++11 library for parsing the maps generated by
[Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/).

The TMX format is based upon XML and may contain compressed and encoded tile
data to save memory and reduce file sizes. This parser uses the
[TinyXML2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/) library and its DOM interface
to parse TMX files.

An example file is provided to understand how to use the library.

## Features

 * Conformity with the [TMX specification page](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format/). (Current Version Support is 1.0)
 * Decodes and decompresses tile data.
 * Can parse properties as integers, real numbers, and literals (strings).
 * Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
 * Does not rely on any graphics library.
 * Animated tile support.
 * Group Layer support.

## Dependencies

 * zlib
 * TinyXML2 >= 6.0.0 

## CMake options
```
USE_MINIZ         "Use miniz.c instead of zlib (default: OFF)"
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build shared libs, otherwise static libs. (default: ON)"
BUILD_TINYXML2    "Build tinyxml2 as external project (default: OFF)"
BUILD_TESTS       "Build tests. (default: OFF)"
BUILD_DOCS        "Build documentation. (default: OFF)"
```

## Installation
tmxparser uses CMake, and the standard CMake build flow works as you'd expect. It's also alternatively available in [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## To Run The Tests
After make, there will be several artifacts within `build/`. One of which is called `run_tests`.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILDTESTS=ON
make
./run_tests
```
